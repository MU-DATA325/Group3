Executive Summary


We used Kaggle.com to find our "Video Game Sales" data set. This set analyzes sales data from more than 16,500 games in countries from all over the world. This was published in 2017 by Gregory Smith. 
The fields are: 
Ranks, Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, NA Sales, EU Sales, JP Sales, Other sales and Global Sales. 


We looked at the data from 2007-2011


Our research question was:
What is the most popular video game genre in the world? 


Our methodology was to use the different packages offered in Rstudio and create tibbles from the data set. We needed to count the genres, find the most produced genre in the given area and follow by counting the worldwide sales between the given years. These tibbles could then be used to create plots to show the different genres of games based on popularity. 

Our findings were that global sales most popular video game genre was action. European sales and North American sales mirrored that in having the most popular genre being action.
